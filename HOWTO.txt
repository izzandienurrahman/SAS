Getting started:
-------------------------------------------
Before we start, make a folder named wemos_php inside the ROOT folder of your XAMPP app.
Make sure all .php files inside ".php files" folder is copied to that folder (wemos_php) <copy the entire files, NOT the folder>
and make sure you are able to start Apache and MySQL service within XAMPP.

Create the database with the following specs:
DB name: 'sas' 
table(s) name: 'sas_tb' and 'halte1'

'sas_tb' specs:
Column	Type						example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
npm 	int primary unique not null			1406531952
valid	tinyint(1)/boolean				1
nama	varchar(255)					Izzan Dienurrahman
in_use	tinyint(1)/boolean				0
time	timestamp <on update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP>		<no need to specify>

'halte1' specs:
Column	Type						example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
slotnum int primary not null 				0
status	tinyint(1)/boolean <default = 1>		1				

The steps I'll be guiding is the one with .ino files in the RELEASE folder
for the .ino files within DEBUG folder the steps are the same except that
you open different .ino files

*For easy database management, open XAMPP start Apache & MySQL go to web browser, type: localhost/phpmyadmin
*from there on, create your db,table,insert contents of the table.

STEP 1
-------------------------------------------
1.Open Arduino IDE using the given code inside RELEASE folder or DEBUG folder (if you want to debug)
2.Open sas_receive_servo_release.ino 
3.Select board "WeMos D1 mini or D1 mini R2"
4.Edit the wifi setup variables with YOUR own wifi SSID and Password
5.Edit the "host" variable to your local machine IP address (not 127.0.0.1 one but the IP of host machine that connects to your wifi)
6.Select the COM port associated with the board (make sure the WeMos drivers are installed, if you don't understand, refer to their website and download the driver)
7.Upload the sketch to WeMos board that acts as a servo controller/parking slot manager
8.Check the arduino serial monitor to see what is the IP address that device is listening to

STEP 2
-------------------------------------------
1.Open sas_send_rfid_release.ino
2.Edit the wifi setup variables with YOUR own wifi SSID and Password
3.Edit the "host" variable to your OTHER WeMos IP address that he is listening to
4.Upload the sketch

STEP 3
-------------------------------------------
1.Start tapping the 'npm' programmed RFID tag to the reader, when the board emits blue light, REMOVE the card
2.Wait for a few secs until the servo is done rotating and you can start tapping another card or the same card

**Sketch = .ino files <basically the code itself>
**Physical circuit Interfacing WeMos to RFID should be done by yourself, there are plenty of references in google search. 
**Physical circuit Interfacing WeMos to Servo is the same, there are plenty of references in google search. 
**<default code uses pin D8 and D4 for the servos, you can change it within the code>

***To program the RFID tag, just uncomment the code on sas_send_rfid_release.ino on line 123 'writeBlock(block, blockcontent)'  
***and fill the 'blockcontent' variable with your desired npm see <RFID SETUP VARIABLES> header, upload the sketch and tap the RFID tag
   
***If the Vcc / Ground pin for the servo is not sufficient, you can extend it using protoboard/breadboard
